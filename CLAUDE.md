# A.I.M.S. — Claude Code Project Instructions

## Deployment Pipeline Rules (READ FIRST)

These three rules determine WHERE every piece of code deploys. Apply them to every task:

```
IF core platform service (ACHEEVY API, UEF Gateway, Per|Form, n8n, PersonaPlex, House of Ang, Redis)
  THEN → Hostinger VPS (76.13.96.107) in Docker
  Files: infra/docker-compose.prod.yml, deploy.sh

IF long-running/scheduled autonomous job or sandbox (content engine, autonomous builds, daily crons)
  THEN → GCP Cloud Run (job or service), trigger via cron/events
  Files: infra/gcp-setup.sh, Cloud Run job configs (TBD)

IF user-facing app/site, dashboard, or static artifact (landing pages, funnels, generated apps)
  THEN → CDN with: shareable URL, optional custom domain, optional paywall
  Target: Vercel / custom CDN (TBD)
```

## Project Overview
A.I.M.S. (AI Managed Solutions) is an AI-managed platform orchestrated by ACHEEVY.
Domain: plugmein.cloud | VPS: 76.13.96.107 | GCP: ai-managed-services

## ACHEEVY Brain
The single source of truth for ACHEEVY's behavior, skills, hooks, and recurring tasks:
**`aims-skills/ACHEEVY_BRAIN.md`**

Read that file before making any changes to ACHEEVY's behavior, skills, hooks, verticals, or chain-of-command logic.

## Current Status & Plan
See **`AIMS_PLAN.md`** for the full SOP, PRD, implementation roadmap, and AIMS_REQUIREMENTS checklist.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) at `frontend/`
- **Backend**: Express gateway at `backend/uef-gateway/`, ACHEEVY service at `backend/acheevy/`
- **Skills Engine**: `aims-skills/` — hooks, skills, tasks, verticals, chain-of-command
- **Infra**: Docker Compose at `infra/`, deploy scripts at root

## Key Rules
1. All tool access goes through Port Authority (UEF Gateway) — no direct service exposure
2. Only ACHEEVY speaks to the user — never internal agent names
3. Every completed task requires evidence (no proof, no done)
4. Skills follow the taxonomy: Hooks (before), Tasks (do), Skills (guide)
5. Verticals have 2 phases: Phase A (conversational), Phase B (execution)

## When Modifying ACHEEVY Behavior
1. Read `aims-skills/ACHEEVY_BRAIN.md` first
2. Make changes in the appropriate file (hooks/, skills/, tasks/, acheevy-verticals/)
3. Update the brain file to reflect changes
4. Export new modules from the relevant index.ts

## Testing
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build    # Frontend build check
cd backend/uef-gateway && npm run build  # Backend build check
cd aims-skills && npm test      # Skills/hooks tests
```
