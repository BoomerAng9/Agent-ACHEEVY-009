## 2025 Redraft — Top 5 Re-Evaluated

### Pick #1 — Cam Ward | QB | Tennessee Titans (Original: #1)

**College (2024):** 4,313 YDS, 39 TD, 7 INT | ACC Player of the Year | Heisman Finalist (4th)

**Rookie Season (2025-26):**
| GP | COMP | ATT | COMP% | YDS | TD | INT | RUSH YDS | RUSH TD | RTG |
|----|------|-----|-------|-----|-----|-----|----------|---------|-----|
| 17 | 323 | 540 | 59.8% | 3,169 | 15 | 7 | 159 | 2 | 80.2 |

**Per|Form Pre-Draft P.A.I.: 96.2 (A+)**
**Per|Form Rookie Performance Grade: 72.4 (B+)**

#### AGI Rookie Assessment
| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **G — Game** | 7.0/10 | 15 TD / 7 INT is below expectations for #1 overall. 59.8% completion down from college. |
| **R — Raw Athletics** | 8.5/10 | Mobility translated. 159 rush yards, 2 rush TDs. Arm talent still evident. |
| **O — Overall Production** | 6.8/10 | 3,169 yards is fine for a rookie but 80.2 rating is bottom-half starter territory. |
| **C — Competition** | 7.5/10 | Full NFL schedule against professional defenses. Adjustment curve expected. |
| **L — Leadership** | 7.5/10 | Started all 17 games. Showed improvement as season progressed (best game: Week 12, 91.0 RTG). |
| **U — Upside** | 8.5/10 | Inconsistent but flashed elite ability. Week 12: 256 YDS, 1 TD, 0 INT. Addressed fumble issues. |
| **K — Known Concerns** | 4.5/10 | Completion percentage drop, early-season fumbles, inconsistency under pressure. |
| **E — Evaluator Confidence** | 8.0/10 | 17 games of NFL data. Trajectory is upward but not yet elite. |

### ACHEEVY's Redraft Take
> "Cam Ward had a typical rookie quarterback season — inconsistent, frustrating at
> times, but with enough flashes to justify the #1 pick. The 59.8% completion rate
> concerns me — that was 74%+ in college. But he started all 17 games, he didn't
> collapse under pressure, and his best game came in Week 12 when he needed it.
> The trajectory matters more than the year-one numbers. I still have him QB1 in
> this class, but the margin is thinner than we projected."
>
> — **ACHEEVY**, Per|Form Lead Analyst

**Uncle Blaze (Heat_Ang):**
> "Let me tell you something! Y'all overreacted to a ROOKIE quarterback learning
> the NFL. 15 touchdowns, 7 picks, started every single game. I been saying this —
> Year 2 is when Cam Ward becomes the player we saw at Miami. Watch."

### Pick #2 — Travis Hunter | CB/WR | Jacksonville Jaguars (Original: #2)

**College (2024):** 96 REC, 1,258 YDS, 15 TD (WR) + 32 tackles, 4 INT (CB) | Heisman Winner

**Rookie Season (2025-26):**
| GP | REC | REC YDS | REC TD | TARGETS | OFF SNAP% | DEF SNAP% |
|----|-----|---------|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 7 | 28 | 298 | 1 | 45 | 67% | 36% |

**Season ended:** Torn LCL (non-contact, Week 9 practice). Season-ending surgery Nov 11.

**Per|Form Pre-Draft P.A.I.: 101.4 (PRIME)**
**Per|Form Rookie Performance Grade: 68.0 (B) — INJURY ADJUSTED**

#### AGI Rookie Assessment
| Component | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **G — Game** | 7.2/10 | 28/45 targets, 298 yards, 1 TD in 7 games. Breakout Week 7: 8 REC, 101 YDS, 1 TD + PBU. |
| **R — Raw Athletics** | 9.0/10 | Athletic gifts still generational. Injury was non-contact, not structural flaw. |
| **O — Overall Production** | 5.5/10 | Only 7 games. Impossible to fully evaluate. Production per game was promising. |
| **C — Competition** | 7.0/10 | NFL competition. Limited sample (7 games). |
| **L — Leadership** | 7.5/10 | Handled dual role professionally. Accepted 67/36 snap split without complaint. |
| **U — Upside** | 9.5/10 | Still generational. Jaguars plan: CB1 + part-time WR in 2026. Full health expected. |
| **K — Known Concerns** | 5.5/10 | Torn LCL. Non-contact injuries at 188 lbs raise durability flags for two-way play. |
| **E — Evaluator Confidence** | 6.0/10 | 7 games is not enough. Must see full 2026 season before confirming or adjusting PRIME tier. |

### ACHEEVY's Redraft Take
> "Travis Hunter's rookie season was tragically cut short. In 7 games, we saw exactly
> what we expected — elite on both sides. Week 7 was a glimpse of his ceiling:
> 8 catches, 101 yards, a touchdown, AND a pass breakup. Then the LCL happened.
> The PRIME designation stands — but it's on hold. We need a full 2026 season
> to confirm what the tape already told us."
>
> — **ACHEEVY**, Per|Form Lead Analyst

**The Professor (Film_First_Ang):**
> "Watch the tape from Week 7. You'll see a player who transitions from a contested
> catch on 3rd-and-8 to blanketing a receiver on the next defensive series. That
> doesn't exist anywhere else in the NFL. The LCL is a setback, not a verdict.
> The film says PRIME. The body needs to cooperate."

## 2025 Redraft — Quick Cards (Picks #3-10)

| Original Pick | Player | Team | Pos | Pre-Draft P.A.I. | Rookie Grade | Redraft Rank |
|---------------|--------|------|-----|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| 3 | Abdul Carter | — | EDGE | 94.8 (A+) | TBD | TBD |
| 4 | Shedeur Sanders | Cleveland Browns | QB | 91.5 (A+) | Fell to Rd 5 (#144) | Re-evaluate |
| 5 | Mason Graham | — | DT | 93.1 (A+) | TBD | TBD |
| 6 | Tetairoa McMillan | — | WR | 92.7 (A+) | TBD | TBD |
| 7 | Will Campbell | — | OT | 90.3 (A+) | TBD | TBD |

> **Note on Shedeur Sanders:** Sanders fell dramatically on draft day — from consensus
> first-round projection to the 5th round (#144 to Cleveland). Per|Form's pre-draft
> P.A.I. of 91.5 was based on pure football evaluation. The draft-day slide appears
> driven by off-field perception, scheme fit concerns, and the Deion factor.
> This is exactly why our Intangibles (I) component includes negative signals.
> **Our AGI system caught the AGI-K (Known Concerns) flag at 3.2/10 —
> the highest concern score among top QB prospects.**

> The last player to reach PRIME was Travis Hunter, and Mendoza's resume is cleaner.

> If a team is picking for impact, not convention, Downs is as safe as it gets."

> what the tape already shows."
