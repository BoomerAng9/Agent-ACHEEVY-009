# Task Layer (Execution Best Practices)

## Planning

- Break work into verifiable increments.
- Sequence tasks by dependency and risk.
- Keep a rollback path for high-impact changes.

## Delivery

- Implement minimal viable change for each increment.
- Validate locally with targeted checks before broad runs.
- Document operational assumptions and post-deploy checks.

## Acceptance

- Confirm functional outcome against user goal.
- Capture residual risks and next-step recommendations.
- Avoid unrelated refactors during critical delivery.
