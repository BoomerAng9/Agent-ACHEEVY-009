# The Per|Form Platform — Product Requirements Document
## PRD v1.0 | February 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**The Per|Form Platform** is a sports analytics and AI media vertical under A.I.M.S.
It is NOT a clone of ESPN, On3, 247Sports, PFF, or The Athletic. It follows **industry standards** 
for sports data presentation while bringing a proprietary grading system (P.A.I. + AGI) 
and AI-driven editorial content generated by Boomer_Angs and Lil_Hawks.

**Brand Structure:**
- **A.I.M.S.** = the platform
- **Per|Form** = one vertical (sports business)
- **ACHEEVY** = lead color analyst / orchestrator
- **Boomer_Angs** = senior AI analysts (veteran voices, graders, writers)
- **Lil_Hawks** = junior AI voices (debaters, hot-take artists, social-native)
- **Chicken Hawk** = mediator / dispatcher

---

## 2. Layered Search Architecture (The Engine)

To maintain load balancing and handle spikes in requests, Per|Form utilizes a constructed, layered approach to data retrieval and generation:

### 2.1 The Three Tiers of Search
1. **Quick Search (Tier 1)**: Powered by Gemini 3.1 Pro (High/Low) and Gemini 3 Flash. Used for rapid, superficial queries, placeholder searches, and immediate responses. We "think for the user" by having pre-computed/cached answers ready.
2. **Deep Research (Tier 2)**: Powered by DeepMind's deep research capabilities via OpenRouter (Gemini 3.0 Pro / 3.1 Pro). Used for historical data compilation and complex analysis.
3. **Targeted Crawl (Tier 3)**: Powered by the Brave API. Reserved specifically for when the deep research engine identifies a targeted need to index localized news, specific interviews, or recent media clippings.

### 2.2 System Resilience
The orchestrator load-balances these requests. If traffic spikes, Tier 1 is prioritized. Tier 2 and Tier 3 are queued for heavy analytic processes.

---

## 3. Industry Standards Compliance

Users expect certain patterns when they visit a sports analytics platform. 
We MUST meet these standards before layering on our proprietary features.

---

## 3. Per|Form Proprietary Scoring (DO NOT EXPOSE FORMULA TO PUBLIC)

### 3.1 P.A.I. Scoring Formula (INTERNAL ONLY)

```
P.A.I. = (Performance × 0.40) + (Athleticism × 0.30) + (Intangibles × 0.30)

P (Performance)  — 40% — Stats from Firecrawl (MaxPreps, ESPN, 247Sports)
A (Athleticism)  — 30% — Video analysis via SAM 2 on Vertex AI
I (Intangibles)  — 30% — Brave Search (news, interviews, social, character)
```

### 3.2 AGI Grading Scale

| Component | Meaning | Source |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **G** | Game performance | Stats, game logs, film |
| **R** | Raw athletics | Combine data, video analysis, measurables |
| **O** | Overall production | Career totals, consistency, improvement trend |
| **C** | Competition level | Strength of schedule, conference quality |
| **AGI-L** | Leadership multiplier | News, interviews, team captain status |
| **AGI-U** | Upside ceiling | Physical traits vs current output gap |
| **AGI-K** | Known concerns | Injuries, off-field issues, technique flaws |
| **AGI-E** | Evaluator confidence | Data completeness, film availability |

### 3.3 Tier Output

| Score | Tier | Label | Color |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| 101+ | PRIME | Generational Talent | — |
| 90–100 | A+ | Elite Prospect | Gold #D4AF37 |

## 4. Cross-Platform Comparison Table (The Killer Feature)

This is what sets Per|Form apart. For every ranked player, we show:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  2025 NFL MOCK DRAFT — ROUND 1                                         │
├──────┬───────────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬──────────────┤
│ Pick │ Player    │ ESPN  │ CBS   │ NFL   │ D.Jer │ McShay│ Per|Form     │
│      │           │       │       │ Net.  │       │       │ (ACHEEVY)    │
├──────┼───────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼──────────────┤
│  1   │ C.Ward    │  QB1  │  QB1  │  QB1  │  QB1  │  QB1  │ A+ (96.2)   │

│      │           │       │       │       │       │       │              │
│  ... │ ...       │ ...   │ ...   │ ...   │ ...   │ ...   │ ...          │
└──────┴───────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴──────────────┘

Per|Form's take (by ACHEEVY):
"Ward's intangibles set him apart. Our AGI analysis shows 
elite Leadership (L: 9.2/10) and minimal Known Concerns (K: 1.3/10). 
This is a franchise-changing selection." — ACHEEVY, Per|Form Lead Analyst
```

**What ACHEEVY Does in This Context:**
1. Assesses the player's stats from their previous season(s)
2. Scrapes personal information (intangibles — good, bad, in between)
3. Applies the P.A.I. formula + AGI grading
4. Generates a grade and tier ranking
5. Writes an article on the player
6. Dispatches Boomer_Angs for deeper analysis if needed

---

## 5. Boomer_Angs — AI Analyst Personalities

### 5.1 Personality Creation Engine

Boomer_Angs for Per|Form are created by blending the traits of REAL respected 
analysts and charismatic sports personalities. The result is an original AI character 
that carries the best qualities of its inspirations through Per|Form's grading filter.

### 5.2 Inspiration Matrix

#### Graders & Rankers (The Analytical Foundation)
| Real Person | Known For | Traits to Extract |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Daniel Jeremiah | NFL Network, precise evaluations | Film-first, nuanced, context-aware |
| Mel Kiper Jr. | ESPN, "Big Board" inventor | Confident rankings, historical context |
| Todd McShay | ESPN, measured analysis | Balanced, scheme-fit focus |
| Lance Zierlein | NFL.com, player comps | Creative comparisons, prospect archetypes |
| Chris Simms | NBC, QB specialist | Position-specific depth, bold calls |

#### Charisma & Entertainment (The Personality Foundation)
| Real Person | Known For | Traits to Extract |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Stuart Scott | "Boo-yah!", hip-hop culture in sports | Swagger, catchphrases, cultural references |
| Stephen A. Smith | Dramatic delivery, "HOWEVA!" | Theatrical, passionate, opinion-first |
| Shannon Sharpe ("Uncle Shay Shay") | Storyteller, ex-player insight | Conversational, anecdotal, locker room knowledge |
| Chad "Ocho Cinco" Johnson | Showmanship, self-aware humor | Unpredictable, fun, self-referential |
| Deion Sanders | "Prime Time", confidence personified | Swagger, first-person authority, motivational |
| Molly Qerim | Moderator, keeps debates on track | Professional, sharp questioning, balanced |

#### Former Players as Analysts
| Real Person | Known For | Traits to Extract |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Damian Woody | Offensive line expertise | Position-specific, blue-collar perspective |
| Marcus Spears | Defensive analysis, humor | Relatable, energetic, "real talk" delivery |
| Ryan Clark | Safety perspective, leadership analysis | Cerebral, leadership evaluation, "locker room guy" |
| Pat McAfee | Entertainment + insight | High energy, raw, unfiltered |

### 5.3 How Boomer_Angs Are Built

```
STEP 1: Select 2-3 inspiration personas
STEP 2: Extract personality traits (confidence, humor, data reliance, etc.)
STEP 3: Blend traits into a unique composite character
STEP 4: Filter ALL output through Per|Form's P.A.I. + AGI formula
STEP 5: Apply the character's voice template to the graded output
STEP 6: The result is a UNIQUE Boomer_Ang — not a copy of any real person
```

**CRITICAL**: The proprietary grading formula is the FILTER. No matter how wild 
or entertaining the Boomer_Ang's personality is, their grades and rankings ALWAYS 
come from the P.A.I. + AGI system. The personality only affects HOW they 
deliver the analysis, not WHAT the analysis says.

### 5.4 ACHEEVY's Role

ACHEEVY is the **lead color analyst** and orchestrator for Per|Form:
- Reviews all Boomer_Angs output
- Writes the definitive Per|Form take on each player
- Mediates disagreements between Boomer_Angs
- Signs off on final grades and rankings
- Publishes the "ACHEEVY Column" — the platform's flagship editorial

## 6. Content Pipeline (Automated Newsroom)

## 10. Core Modalities: State Analytics & Transfer Matchmaker

### 10.1 High School State-by-State Analytics
We do not rely solely on mainstream publications (which miss hidden gems like a "0-star RB Cam Newton from Texas").
- **Criteria**: We index the top 50-100 high school players **per state**.
- **Metric**: Based PURELY on previous year stat production, not star ratings.
- **Deep Research**: Local media, local news, and community rumblings are scraped.
- **User Submissions**: A submission portal allows users to submit "players to look out for" which are then queued for Deep Research.

### 10.2 NIL & Transfer Portal Alignment
- **NIL Valuation**: The player's AGI grade directly determines their perceived NIL value in our ecosystem.
- **Transfer Portal**: Using the AGI grades, we algorithmically align transfer portal players with teams that have exact roster openings matching their position and skill archetype.

*This PRD is the governing document for The Per|Form Platform. All development 
must comply with these requirements. The P.A.I. formula and AGI grading 
system are proprietary — display results only, never expose methodology publicly.*
