3. The Fill-Mask Association Test (FMAT): Measuring Propositions in Natural Language 
The Fill-Mask Association Test (FMAT): Measuring Propositions in Natural Language 
Authors: Han-Wu-Shuang Bao 
Published: In press (as of April 12, 2024) in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 
Research Question: How well can the Fill-Mask Association Test (FMAT) measure semantic associations in natural language? 
Key Methodologies 
Use of BERT language models to compute semantic probabilities of words filling in masked blanks in designed queries 
Comparison of FMAT results to previous findings from human participants and other text analysis methods 
15 studies examining factual associations, attitudes/biases, social stereotypes, and sociocultural changes over time 
Primary Findings 
FMAT demonstrated good reliability and validity in measuring various psychological constructs 
Results replicated seminal findings previously obtained with human participants and other methods 
FMAT allowed for more fine-grained measurement of theoretical constructs by specifying relational information 
Findings support a propositional perspective on how semantic associations are represented in natural language 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Accuracy of AI language models in capturing human-like associations: The FMAT method demonstrates that BERT models can reliably capture semantic associations similar to those found in human cognition, suggesting potential for synthetic users to exhibit human-like patterns of thought. 
Measurement of implicit attitudes and biases: FMAT's ability to measure implicit attitudes and biases indicates that synthetic users based on similar models might be able to simulate these subtle aspects of human cognition. 
Representation of cultural and historical knowledge: The study's findings on sociocultural changes suggest that language models can encode cultural and historical information, which could inform the creation of synthetic users from different time periods or cultural backgrounds. 
Supporting Evidence 
The FMAT demonstrated high reliability and validity in predicting factual associations, such as gender distribution in occupations and names. For example, in Study 1A, FMAT gender scores of 50 occupations strongly correlated with actual percentages of male workers (r = .74, p < .001). 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that synthetic users based on similar language models could accurately represent factual knowledge about demographic distributions in various domains. 
Studies 2A-2D showed that FMAT could replicate classic findings on attitudes and biases, such as implicit preferences for flowers over insects or young over old people. The method was also able to distinguish between attitudinal and non-attitudinal associations. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that synthetic users might be capable of simulating both explicit and implicit attitudes, as well as differentiating between various types of associations, leading to more nuanced and realistic responses. 
Studies 4A-4D demonstrated FMAT's ability to capture perceived sociocultural changes over time, such as declining gender and racial biases in occupational participation and increasing individualism in American culture. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that synthetic users could potentially be calibrated to represent perspectives from different historical periods or to simulate changing cultural attitudes over time. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper notes that FMAT effect sizes were often smaller than those found with human participants using methods like the Implicit Association Test (IAT). For example, in Study 2A, the FMAT effect size for flower-insect attitude was d = 0.37, compared to d = 1.35 for the IAT. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that synthetic users based on similar models might exhibit weaker or less extreme attitudes and biases compared to real humans, potentially leading to underestimation of the strength of human biases. 
The author acknowledges that the exact demographic characteristics of the text producers for the training corpora are unlikely to be identified, although they are assumed to be primarily English speakers from Anglophone countries. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This limitation in demographic specificity of the training data could lead to synthetic users that are biased towards certain populations and may not accurately represent diverse demographic groups. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study focuses on English language models and primarily Anglophone perspectives. There is a need to extend the research to other languages and cultures. 
Potential Solution: Future research could apply the FMAT method to BERT models trained on non-English corpora to create more culturally diverse synthetic users. 
The paper does not explore individual differences or specific demographic subgroups beyond broad categories like gender and race. 
Potential Solution: Further studies could investigate how well language models capture more fine-grained individual differences or represent specific demographic subgroups, informing the creation of more personalized synthetic users. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper raises concerns about the potential for language models to inherit and perpetuate societal biases present in their training data. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: When creating synthetic users, researchers must be aware that these AI-generated personas may reflect and potentially amplify existing societal biases, requiring careful monitoring and mitigation strategies. 
The author notes that some BERT models have been intentionally debiased, which could distort data that should reflect social reality for research purposes. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This raises questions about whether synthetic users should be designed to reflect actual human biases for accurate representation, or if they should be debiased to promote more ethical outcomes. 
Practical Applications 
The FMAT method could be adapted to generate responses from synthetic users by using the most probable word completions for carefully designed queries. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This approach would allow for more efficient and scalable collection of responses compared to traditional human participant recruitment, while still capturing nuanced associations and attitudes. 
The ability of FMAT to capture perceived historical changes could be used to create synthetic users representing different time periods or to simulate changing attitudes over time. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This would provide a unique capability to explore historical perspectives or project future trends, which is challenging to achieve with traditional research methods relying on contemporary human participants. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The study relies on pre-trained BERT models, which may not always reflect the most current societal attitudes or knowledge. 
Potential Mitigation: Regular updating and fine-tuning of language models with more recent data could help keep synthetic users current and relevant. 
The paper notes that a single BERT model often produces unreliable results, requiring aggregation across multiple models for robust findings. 
Potential Mitigation: When implementing synthetic users, responses should be generated from an ensemble of models to ensure greater reliability and consistency. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigate how well the FMAT method and similar approaches can capture more complex psychological constructs beyond attitudes and stereotypes, such as personality traits or decision-making processes. 
Rationale: This would expand the range of human characteristics that could be accurately simulated in synthetic users, increasing their realism and utility for various research applications. 
Explore the potential for fine-tuning language models on specific demographic subgroups to create more targeted and accurate synthetic user profiles. 
Rationale: This could address the current limitations in demographic specificity and enable the creation of synthetic users that more precisely represent particular population segments. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The study demonstrates that BERT models can accurately capture broad demographic trends, such as gender distributions in occupations and names (Studies 1A-1C). It also shows that these models can reflect cultural differences over time (Studies 4A-4D). However, the research does not delve into fine-grained demographic distinctions or individual-level accuracy. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: While synthetic users based on these models might accurately represent broad demographic trends and cultural shifts, they may struggle to capture nuanced differences between individuals or specific subgroups within larger demographic categories. Careful validation would be needed to ensure synthetic users accurately represent the intended demographic profiles, especially for more specific or intersectional identities. 
Overall Assessment 
The Fill-Mask Association Test (FMAT) demonstrates that large language models can reliably capture human-like semantic associations, attitudes, and biases, as well as reflect cultural and historical knowledge. This suggests significant potential for creating synthetic users that exhibit realistic cognitive patterns and cultural awareness. However, limitations in demographic specificity, potential perpetuation of societal biases, and the need for model ensembles present challenges that must be addressed for effective implementation. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The FMAT's success in replicating various psychological phenomena using language models provides strong support for the feasibility of synthetic users. The method's ability to capture subtle attitudes, cultural knowledge, and historical changes suggests that synthetic users could potentially provide rich, nuanced responses across a wide range of domains. However, the identified limitations and ethical considerations indicate that careful design and validation processes would be crucial for creating accurate and responsible synthetic user systems. 
Suggested Refinements 
Refinement: Develop methods to fine-tune language models on more specific demographic data to create more accurate and diverse synthetic user profiles. 
Justification: This would address the current limitations in demographic specificity and allow for the creation of synthetic users that more precisely represent particular population segments or individuals. 
Refinement: Incorporate explicit bias detection and mitigation techniques in the synthetic user generation process. 
Justification: This would help address ethical concerns about perpetuating societal biases while maintaining the ability to accurately represent human cognition when necessary for research purposes.

Compared responses across different demographic prompts 
Primary Findings 
Demographic features in prompts significantly affect LLM responses on the Political Compass Test 
There are disparities between closed-form and open-ended responses 
Similar justifications (tropes) are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances 
Some models (e.g. OLMo) showed less variation in responses across demographic prompts 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Demographic Mimicry: The paper directly examines how LLMs respond when prompted with different demographic characteristics, which is central to the concept of Synthetic Users and their ability to represent diverse populations. 
Response Consistency: The study's analysis of tropes reveals patterns in LLM responses across different prompts, which is relevant to understanding the reliability and consistency of Synthetic Users. 
Model Variability: The paper's comparison of different LLMs shows that some models are more affected by demographic prompts than others, which has implications for selecting appropriate models for Synthetic Users. 
Supporting Evidence

Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that LLMs can potentially mimic different demographic groups to some extent, supporting the feasibility of Synthetic Users. 
The extraction of tropes revealed common justifications used across different models and prompts, even when the final stances differed. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that LLMs can generate coherent and consistent reasoning patterns, which is important for creating believable Synthetic Users. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The study found disparities between closed-form and open-ended responses, with models often giving more neutral or refusing to answer in open-ended formats. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that Synthetic Users may not consistently mimic human behavior across different response formats, potentially limiting their applicability. 
Some models, like OLMo, showed little variation in responses across demographic prompts. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that not all LLMs are equally capable of mimicking different demographics, which could limit the diversity of Synthetic Users depending on the model used. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study focused on political opinions and values, but did not explore other aspects of user behavior or preferences. 
Potential Solution: Future research could apply similar methodologies to analyze LLM responses in other domains relevant to user research, such as product preferences or user experience. 
The paper did not compare LLM responses to actual human responses from different demographic groups. 
Potential Solution: A follow-up study could administer the same Political Compass Test to human participants from various demographics and compare their responses to those generated by LLMs. 
Ethical Considerations 
The study reveals that LLMs can be steered to generate biased responses based on demographic prompts. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This raises concerns about the potential for Synthetic Users to perpetuate or amplify societal biases if not carefully designed and monitored. 
The paper shows that LLMs can generate coherent justifications for various political stances, even when those stances change based on prompts. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This capability could be misused to generate artificial support for particular viewpoints, necessitating careful ethical guidelines for the use of Synthetic Users in research or public discourse. 
Practical Applications 
Using LLMs with demographic prompts to generate diverse perspectives on political or social issues. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This could potentially provide a broader range of viewpoints more quickly and at lower cost than traditional survey methods, but may lack the nuance and authenticity of real human responses. 
Analyzing tropes in LLM responses to understand common reasoning patterns associated with different demographics or viewpoints. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This could offer insights into argumentation structures more efficiently than manual coding of human responses, but may miss important nuances or novel arguments that humans might provide. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The study found that LLM responses can vary significantly based on small changes in prompts or question formats. 
Potential Mitigation: Developing more robust prompting techniques or aggregating responses across multiple prompts could help create more stable Synthetic Users. 
The paper focused on English-language models and Western political concepts. 
Potential Mitigation: Future research should explore the capabilities of multilingual models and consider non-Western cultural and political frameworks to create more globally representative Synthetic Users. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigate the long-term consistency of LLM-generated personas across multiple interactions or conversations. 
Rationale: This would help determine if Synthetic Users can maintain coherent personalities and viewpoints over time, which is crucial for their use in extended user research scenarios. 
Explore techniques to fine-tune LLMs on real demographic data to improve their mimicry of specific user groups. 
Rationale: This could potentially increase the accuracy and authenticity of Synthetic Users, making them more representative of real demographic groups. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The study demonstrates that LLMs can produce different responses when prompted with various demographic characteristics, particularly for political orientation, gender, and economic class. However, the accuracy of these responses in mimicking real demographic groups was not directly assessed. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: While the results suggest that LLMs have some capability to generate responses aligned with different demographics, further research is needed to validate the accuracy of this mimicry against real human data. The variation in model performance (e.g., OLMo's relative invariance to demographic prompts) also indicates that the choice of LLM is crucial for creating effective Synthetic Users. 
Overall Assessment 
The paper provides valuable insights into the behavior of LLMs when prompted with demographic information, revealing both capabilities and limitations relevant to the concept of Synthetic Users. While the study demonstrates that LLMs can generate varied responses based on demographic prompts and produce consistent reasoning patterns (tropes), it also highlights challenges such as response format disparities and varying model performance. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The research generally supports the potential of Synthetic Users by showing that LLMs can generate diverse responses based on demographic prompts. However, it also reveals important limitations and challenges that need to be addressed for effective implementation.

Virtual Personas for Language Models via an Anthology of Backstories 
Authors: Suhong Moon, Marwa Abdulhai, Minwoo Kang, Joseph Suh, Widyadewi Soedarmadji, Eran Kohen Behar, David M. Chan 
Published: July 9, 2024 in arXiv preprint 
Research Question: How can large language models (LLMs) be conditioned to represent particular virtual personas that are representative, consistent, and diverse? 
Key Methodologies 
Generating an "Anthology" of open-ended life narratives (backstories) using LLMs 
Conditioning LLMs with these backstories to create virtual personas 
Matching virtual personas to target human demographics 
Comparing responses of backstory-conditioned LLMs to human survey responses 
Primary Findings 
Anthology method improved matching of human response distributions by up to 18% 
Consistency metrics improved by up to 27% 
Backstory-conditioned LLMs better represented diverse sub-populations 
Matching virtual personas to target demographics further enhanced approximation of human responses 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
AI-generated personas: The paper's Anthology method uses LLMs to generate backstories, which are then used to condition LLMs to act as virtual personas. This directly aligns with the Synthetic Users concept of using AI to create simulated user personas. 
Demographic representation: The paper focuses on creating virtual personas that match specific demographic profiles, which is a key aspect of the Synthetic Users concept for representing diverse user groups. 
Survey response simulation: The research evaluates the ability of virtual personas to approximate human responses in large-scale surveys, which is a potential application of Synthetic Users in market research and user studies. 
Supporting Evidence 
The paper demonstrates improved performance in matching human response distributions: "Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that the Anthology method could enhance the accuracy of Synthetic Users in representing real human responses, particularly in survey-like scenarios. 
The research shows better representation of diverse sub-populations: "We show superior conditioning to personas reflecting users from under-represented groups, with improvements of up to 18% in terms Wasserstein Distance and 27% in consistency." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that the Anthology approach could help address one of the key challenges in Synthetic Users - accurately representing diverse demographic groups. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper acknowledges limitations in fully simulating individual users: "We do not suggest that LLMs can fully simulate a given human user merely by using a user's backstory as a prompt prefix." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This highlights that while the Anthology method improves persona simulation, it still falls short of perfectly replicating individual human responses, which is a key consideration for the Synthetic Users concept. 
The authors note potential biases in LLM-generated content: "There is an ongoing concern regarding the ethical use of virtual personas, especially regarding privacy, consent, and the potential for misuse in scenarios like deep fakes or manipulation in political and social spheres." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This raises ethical concerns about the use of Synthetic Users, particularly in sensitive contexts or where the AI-generated responses might be mistaken for real human opinions. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The paper focuses primarily on survey responses and does not explore more complex user behaviors or interactions. 
Potential Solution: Future research could extend the Anthology method to simulate more dynamic user interactions, such as product usage scenarios or customer service conversations. 
The study is limited to text-based responses and does not consider multimodal data. 
Potential Solution: Incorporating multimodal data (e.g., images, audio) into backstory generation and persona conditioning could create more comprehensive Synthetic Users. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper raises concerns about privacy and consent in using AI-generated personas: "There is an ongoing concern regarding the ethical use of virtual personas, especially regarding privacy, consent, and the potential for misuse in scenarios like deep fakes or manipulation in political and social spheres." 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This highlights the need for clear ethical guidelines and transparency in the use of Synthetic Users, especially when they are used to represent real demographic groups or influence decision-making. 
The authors discuss the potential for perpetuating biases: "If the training data is skewed or non-representative, the resulting personas may inadvertently perpetuate these biases." 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This emphasizes the importance of using diverse and representative data in training Synthetic Users to avoid reinforcing societal biases or misrepresenting certain groups. 
Practical Applications 
The paper demonstrates the use of virtual personas in approximating large-scale human studies, specifically the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP) surveys. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This approach could potentially reduce costs and time associated with recruiting large, diverse samples of human participants. It also allows for rapid iteration and testing of survey questions before deploying to real respondents. 
The Anthology method could be used to generate diverse user personas for product testing and market research. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This could allow companies to quickly simulate responses from a wide range of demographic groups without the need for extensive recruitment, potentially leading to more inclusive product design and marketing strategies. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The paper notes that "the computational cost associated with training and deploying state-of-the-art LLMs conditioned with detailed backstories is substantial, which may limit the scalability of this approach for widespread practical applications." 
Potential Mitigation: Future research could focus on optimizing the Anthology method for efficiency, possibly through techniques like model distillation or more targeted backstory generation. 
The authors acknowledge that "While backstories provide a rich context for generating personas, the current models may not consistently apply this context across different types of queries or interactions, leading to variability in persona consistency." 
Potential Mitigation: Developing improved methods for maintaining persona consistency across varied interactions and contexts could enhance the reliability of Synthetic Users. 
Future Research Directions 
Extending the Anthology method to more complex, interactive scenarios beyond survey responses. 
Rationale: This would test the limits of virtual personas in simulating real-world user behaviors and interactions, potentially expanding the applications of Synthetic Users. 
Investigating the long-term stability and consistency of virtual personas across multiple interactions or over time. 
Rationale: This would address concerns about the reliability of Synthetic Users in longitudinal studies or repeated interactions. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The paper reports improvements in matching human response distributions (up to 18%) and consistency metrics (up to 27%) when using the Anthology method. It also demonstrates better performance in representing under-represented groups. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: These findings suggest that the Anthology method could significantly enhance the accuracy of Synthetic Users in mimicking specific demographic groups, particularly in survey-like contexts. However, the improvements, while substantial, still indicate a gap between virtual personas and real human responses, suggesting that further refinement is needed for perfect demographic mimicry. 
Overall Assessment 
The paper presents a promising approach for creating more representative and consistent virtual personas using LLMs, demonstrating improvements in matching human response distributions and representing diverse demographics. However, it also acknowledges limitations in fully simulating individual users and raises important ethical considerations. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The Anthology method aligns closely with the goals of Synthetic Users, providing a concrete approach for generating diverse AI personas and demonstrating their potential in approximating human responses. The improvements in demographic representation and response consistency support the feasibility of using AI-generated personas in research contexts. However, the acknowledged limitations and ethical concerns highlight the need for careful implementation and further refinement of the Synthetic Users concept. 
Suggested Refinements 
Refinement: Incorporate more dynamic and interactive scenarios to test the limits of virtual persona consistency and adaptability. 
Justification: This would address the current limitation of focusing primarily on survey responses and help determine the viability of Synthetic Users in more complex user research contexts. 
Refinement: Develop robust ethical guidelines and transparency measures for the use of virtual personas in research and decision-making contexts. 
Justification: This would address the ethical concerns raised in the paper and help establish trust in the use of Synthetic Users, particularly when representing real demographic groups.

This methodology could be adapted to evaluate the personality authenticity of AI-generated personas. 
Inheritance of traits from training data: The finding that models inherit personality traits from their training data suggests that careful curation of training datasets could potentially improve the accuracy of Synthetic Users in representing specific demographic groups. 
Altering AI personality traits: The exploration of methods to alter model personalities through fine-tuning could inform techniques for adjusting Synthetic User personas to better match target demographics or user groups. 
Supporting Evidence 
The paper demonstrates that language models can be assessed for personality traits using established psychological frameworks like the Big Five factors. For example, the authors state: "Our work seeks to address this gap by exploring the personality traits of several large-scale language models designed for open-ended text generation and the datasets used for training them." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that Synthetic Users could potentially be evaluated and validated using similar personality assessment techniques, helping to ensure their responses align with intended demographic profiles. 
The research shows that different language models exhibit varied personality profiles. As noted in the results: "We observe noticeable variations in trait distributions of text generated using different language models, as illustrated in Figures 5 and 6." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This variability across models indicates that careful selection and potential combination of different language models might be necessary to create Synthetic Users that accurately represent diverse personality types.

Supporting Evidence 
The paper demonstrates that LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, exhibit human-like personality stability and consistency on the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI). 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that LLMs could potentially generate responses consistent with specific personality types, supporting the creation of stable synthetic user personas. 
The PERSONALITY PROMPTING (P2) method successfully induces specific personalities in LLMs, as verified by both MPI assessments and human evaluation of vignette responses. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that synthetic users could be "programmed" with specific personality traits, allowing for the creation of diverse user profiles for research purposes. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper focuses on personality traits rather than specific demographic characteristics, which are a key aspect of the Synthetic Users concept. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: While personality is an important aspect of user profiles, the paper does not directly address how accurately LLMs can represent specific demographic groups, which is crucial for the Synthetic Users concept. 
The study primarily uses English language models and Western personality frameworks (Big Five), which may not generalize to all cultures and demographics. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This limitation raises questions about the global applicability of the approach for creating synthetic users from diverse cultural backgrounds. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The paper does not explore how induced personalities interact with factual knowledge or domain-specific expertise. 
Potential Solution: Future research could investigate how to combine personality induction with knowledge injection to create synthetic users with both consistent personalities and relevant domain knowledge. 
The study does not address how induced personalities might change over time or in response to different contexts. 
Potential Solution: Longitudinal studies could be conducted to examine the stability of induced personalities and develop methods for creating dynamic synthetic user profiles. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper raises questions about the ethical implications of manipulating AI models to exhibit specific personalities. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This concern extends to the creation of synthetic users, as it involves generating artificial personas that may influence real-world decisions and research outcomes. 
The study acknowledges potential biases in language models towards Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) populations. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This bias could limit the ability of synthetic users to accurately represent diverse global populations, potentially perpetuating existing biases in research and market analysis.

Age-based impersonation recovers human-like developmental stages in exploration behavior 
Expert impersonation improves performance on domain-specific tasks 
Impersonation reveals societal biases related to age, gender, and race 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
AI-generated personas: The paper demonstrates that LLMs can effectively impersonate different personas (e.g., ages, expertise levels) through in-context prompting, which is a key aspect of the Synthetic Users concept. 
Demographic representation: The study shows that LLMs can mimic behaviors associated with different ages, genders, and races, which is relevant to creating diverse synthetic user profiles. 
Task performance variation: The paper reveals that impersonation affects model performance on various tasks, which is important for understanding how synthetic users might perform in different scenarios. 
Supporting Evidence 
LLMs impersonating children of different ages recovered human-like developmental stages of exploration in a two-armed bandit task. The paper states: "We find that impersonating LLMs can recover human-like developmental stages of exploration in a two-armed bandit task." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that synthetic users could potentially mimic age-appropriate decision-making behaviors, enhancing the realism of user simulations across different age groups. 
LLMs impersonating domain experts performed better on relevant tasks. The paper notes: "Asking LLMs to impersonate domain experts, they performed better than LLMs that were asked to impersonate a non-domain expert." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that synthetic users could be tailored to represent different levels of expertise, allowing for more accurate simulations of user groups with varying knowledge backgrounds. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper revealed that impersonation can uncover biases in LLMs. For example, "LLMs impersonating a black person or a male describe cars better, while LLMs impersonating a white person or a female describe birds better." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that synthetic users may inherit and amplify societal biases, potentially leading to inaccurate or stereotypical representations of certain demographic groups. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study primarily focused on impersonation in specific tasks (bandit, reasoning, vision-language) and did not explore more open-ended or interactive scenarios. 
Potential Solution: Future research could investigate how in-context impersonation performs in dynamic, multi-turn conversations or complex decision-making scenarios to better simulate real-world user interactions. 
The paper did not compare AI-generated responses to those of real human participants from the impersonated demographics. 
Potential Solution: Conduct studies that directly compare impersonated LLM responses to responses from actual human participants to validate the accuracy of synthetic user simulations. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper highlights that impersonation can reveal and potentially amplify societal biases present in the training data of LLMs. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: Using synthetic users in research or decision-making processes could inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. 
The authors note: "We specifically discourage crafting (system) prompts for maximal performance by exploiting biases, as this may have unexpected side effects, reinforce societal biases and poison training data obtained with such prompts." 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This warning applies directly to the development and use of synthetic users, highlighting the need for careful prompt design and bias mitigation strategies. 
Practical Applications 
Using in-context impersonation to simulate user behaviors across different age groups for product testing or user experience research.

Investigate the long-term stability and consistency of impersonated personas across extended interactions or multiple sessions. 
Rationale: This would help determine if synthetic users can maintain coherent and realistic behaviors over time, which is crucial for longitudinal studies or extended user simulations. 
Explore the potential of combining in-context impersonation with other AI techniques to create more sophisticated and accurate synthetic users. 
Rationale: Integrating impersonation capabilities with other AI models or datasets could potentially enhance the realism and accuracy of synthetic user simulations. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The study showed that LLMs could successfully mimic age-related behaviors in exploration tasks and expertise-related performance in domain-specific tasks. However, it also revealed that impersonation reproduced societal biases related to gender and race. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: While the results suggest that synthetic users could potentially mimic certain demographic-specific behaviors accurately, the reproduction of biases indicates that care must be taken to ensure fair and accurate representation across all demographic groups. The accuracy of mimicry may vary depending on the specific task or domain, and validation against real human data is crucial. 
Overall Assessment 
The paper demonstrates that in-context impersonation can effectively influence LLM behavior to mimic different personas, including age groups, expertise levels, and social identities. While this shows promise for creating diverse synthetic users, it also reveals potential pitfalls in terms of bias reproduction and the need for careful validation. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The study provides evidence that LLMs can adopt different personas and exhibit behaviors consistent with those personas, which is fundamental to the concept of synthetic users. However, it also highlights important challenges and ethical considerations that need to be addressed in the development and application of synthetic users.

Authors: Jörg Drechsler and Anna-Carolina Haensch 
Published: 2024 in Statistical Science 
Research Question: How have synthetic data approaches developed over the past 30 years, and what are their current applications, methodologies, and challenges? 
Key Methodologies 
Literature review 
Historical analysis 
Comparative analysis of different synthetic data approaches 
Primary Findings 
Synthetic data approaches have evolved significantly over 30 years, with increased interest in recent years 
Multiple methodologies exist, including statistical and machine learning approaches 
Synthetic data is used for various purposes, including broadening access to sensitive data and training machine learning models 
Challenges remain in measuring utility and disclosure risks of synthetic data 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Data Generation Techniques: The paper discusses various methods for generating synthetic data, which could potentially be adapted for creating synthetic user profiles. For example, the paper mentions "Several of the early applications of synthetic data only focused on speci?c types of data, such as time series or count and binary data." This suggests that different techniques might be more suitable for different types of user data. 
Privacy and Confidentiality: The paper extensively covers privacy concerns and methods to protect confidentiality in synthetic data. This is highly relevant to Synthetic Users, as it addresses potential ethical concerns about using AI-generated personas. The paper states: "There is an increasing tension between the societal bene?ts of our digitized world and broad data access on one hand and the potential harms resulting from the misuse of data that have not been suf?ciently protected on the other hand." 
Utility and Accuracy: The paper discusses methods for evaluating the utility and accuracy of synthetic data, which is crucial for assessing how well Synthetic Users might mimic real demographic groups. The authors note: "Utility metrics can be broadly divided into three categories: The ?rst category, commonly referred to as global utility metrics or broad measures of utility, tries to assess the utility by directly comparing the original data with the protected data." 
Supporting Evidence 
The paper discusses advanced machine learning techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for creating synthetic data. It states: "GANs turned out to be extremely successful for image and speech recognition and natural language understanding. Early applications of GANs for data synthesis also focused on generating synthetic images (see, e.g., [44]). However, the approach was quickly adapted for synthesizing microdata." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that similar advanced AI techniques could potentially be used to generate realistic synthetic user profiles and responses. 
The paper mentions successful applications of synthetic data in various fields: "Beyond the microdata context that is the focus of this review, GANs have also been used to create realistic images of, for example, skin lesions [78], pathology slides [124], and chest X-rays [197]." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This demonstrates the potential for AI to generate realistic data across diverse domains, which could extend to creating synthetic user personas for various industries or research contexts. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper highlights ongoing challenges in measuring the disclosure risks of fully synthetic data: "Measuring disclosure risks for fully synthetic data remains challenging. While most researchers agree that fully synthetic data are not free from risk, more research is needed to quantify these risks under realistic settings." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that there may be unforeseen risks or inaccuracies in using synthetic users, particularly if they are based on or contain sensitive information from real individuals. 
The authors note limitations in current synthetic data approaches: "It remains an open question whether the methodology can be suf?ciently improved to be able to generate differentially private synthetic data with acceptable levels of utility for these complex data products in the future." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This implies that current methods may not be sufficiently advanced to accurately replicate complex human characteristics and behaviors across diverse demographic groups. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The paper focuses primarily on generating synthetic datasets rather than individual synthetic personas or responses. 
Potential Solution: Future research could explore adapting synthetic data generation techniques specifically for creating individual synthetic users with consistent personalities and demographic characteristics. 
The paper does not extensively discuss the generation of synthetic textual or conversational data. 
Potential Solution: Investigate the application of natural language processing and generation techniques in combination with synthetic data approaches to create more realistic synthetic user responses and conversations. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper extensively discusses privacy and confidentiality concerns related to synthetic data. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: Similar ethical considerations would apply to synthetic users, particularly regarding the potential for re-identification or disclosure of sensitive information about real individuals or groups that the synthetic users are based on. 
The authors mention the challenge of balancing utility and privacy: "There is an inherent trade-off between data protection and data utility: increasing the level of protection will inevitably lead to lower utility, as some information will be lost." 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This trade-off would also apply to synthetic users, where increased realism and accuracy might come at the cost of increased privacy risks or potential biases. 
Practical Applications 
The paper mentions the use of synthetic data for training machine learning models: "In industry, the increased reliance on machine learning methods for decision-making results in ever-growing demands for more data to train these models." 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: Synthetic users could potentially be used to generate diverse training data for machine learning models in user research or market analysis, potentially overcoming limitations in data availability or diversity compared to traditional data collection methods. 
The paper discusses the use of synthetic data for broadening access to sensitive data: "The idea to generate synthetic data as a tool for broadening access to sensitive microdata has been proposed for the ?rst time three decades ago." 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: Synthetic users could potentially allow researchers to explore sensitive topics or hard-to-reach populations without the ethical concerns or practical difficulties of recruiting real participants, though this would require careful validation against real-world data. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The paper notes the difficulty in preserving complex relationships in synthetic data: "Finding a model that re?ects all relationships in a complex dataset with hundreds of variables and complicated logical constraints between the variables can be challenging." 
Potential Mitigation: For synthetic users, this could be addressed by focusing on generating personas for specific, well-defined use cases rather than attempting to create universally applicable synthetic users. 
The authors highlight the challenge of measuring utility: "It remains an open question whether the methodology can be suf?ciently improved to be able to generate differentially private synthetic data with acceptable levels of utility for these complex data products in the future." 
Potential Mitigation: Develop specific metrics and validation techniques for assessing the realism and utility of synthetic users in the context of user research and market analysis. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigate the application of advanced machine learning techniques like GANs specifically for generating synthetic user personas and responses. 
Rationale: The paper discusses the success of GANs in generating synthetic data across various domains, suggesting potential for application in creating more realistic synthetic users. 
Develop methods for preserving and accurately replicating complex relationships and constraints in synthetic user data.

Authors: Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Zach Studdiford, Krirk Nirunwiroj, Agam Goyal, Vincent V. Frigo, Sijia Yang, Dhavan Shah, Junjie Hu, Timothy T. Rogers 
Published: 2024 in arXiv preprint 
Research Question: Can large language model (LLM) agents better align with human behavior by integrating information from empirically-derived human belief networks, compared to using demographic information alone? 
Key Methodologies 
Factor analysis to construct human belief networks from survey data 
Creation of LLM agents using different prompting strategies (demographic info only, demographic + single belief, etc.) 
Comparison of LLM agent opinions to human survey responses across different topics 
Primary Findings 
Demographic information alone did not align LLM and human opinions 
Seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network 
Alignment did not improve for topics outside the network 
Degree of alignment reflected the strength of factor loadings in the belief network 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Accuracy of AI-generated responses: The study directly examines how well LLM agents can mimic human opinions across different topics, which is central to the Synthetic Users concept's goal of accurately representing diverse user perspectives. 
Importance of underlying belief structures: The research suggests that accurate synthetic users may require modeling of interconnected belief networks rather than relying solely on demographic information. 
Limitations of demographic-based modeling: The study's finding that demographic information alone was insufficient for alignment challenges assumptions about creating synthetic users based primarily on demographic profiles. 
Supporting Evidence 
The study found that "seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network, and not for topics outside the network." This suggests that LLMs can potentially mimic human opinion patterns when given appropriate contextual information. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This finding supports the potential of creating more accurate synthetic users by incorporating belief network information, rather than relying solely on demographic data. 
The researchers observed that "the degree of alignment following the training prompt reflects strength of the topic's participation in the corresponding belief network," indicating a systematic relationship between belief network structure and LLM alignment. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that carefully constructed belief networks could potentially be used to generate more nuanced and accurate synthetic user responses across related topics. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper states that "demographic role-playing alone does not produce significant alignment," which contradicts the idea that simple demographic prompts can create accurate synthetic users. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This finding challenges the notion that synthetic users can be easily created by providing demographic information to an LLM, suggesting that more sophisticated approaches may be necessary. 
The study found limitations in alignment for certain topics, noting that "at least one topic (death penalty) showed zero alignment even when given the correct opinion in the prompt." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that there may be inherent biases or limitations in LLMs that prevent accurate mimicry of human opinions on certain topics, potentially limiting the scope of synthetic user applications. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study focused on a limited set of topics derived from two orthogonal latent factors. There is an opportunity to expand the scope to a broader range of topics and more complex belief networks. 
Potential Solution: Future research could apply the methodology to a more comprehensive set of topics and use more sophisticated network modeling techniques like Bayesian networks. 
The research primarily used Likert-scale ratings, which may not fully capture the nuances of human opinions in real-world settings. 
Potential Solution: Exploring more complex actions, such as generating social media posts or engaging in dialogues, could provide a richer understanding of LLM agents' ability to mimic human behavior. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper mentions developing LLM agents capable of simulating "potentially harmful beliefs such as misconception about the reality of global warming." This raises ethical concerns about the potential misuse of synthetic users to spread misinformation. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: Creators of synthetic users must carefully consider the ethical implications of generating and potentially amplifying harmful or false beliefs, even in research contexts. 
The study aims to create more accurate simulations of human communicative dynamics, which could be used to manipulate or exploit real human behavior if misused. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: The development of synthetic users should include safeguards and guidelines to prevent their use in deceptive or manipulative practices. 
Practical Applications 
The methodology could be used to create more accurate synthetic users for testing communication strategies around controversial topics. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This approach may provide more nuanced and realistic responses compared to traditional demographic-based personas, potentially leading to more effective message tailoring and campaign design. 
The belief network approach could be applied to create synthetic users for simulating public responses to new policies or products. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This method may capture interconnected beliefs more accurately than traditional survey methods, allowing for better prediction of potential public reactions and unintended consequences. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The study relied on a dataset from 2018, which may not reflect current belief structures or opinion distributions. 
Potential Mitigation: Regular updates to the underlying belief network data would be necessary to maintain accuracy in synthetic user responses over time. 
The research focused on US-based respondents, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to other cultural contexts. 
Potential Mitigation: Expanding the study to include diverse cultural and geographical contexts would be crucial for developing globally applicable synthetic user methodologies. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigate the use of more complex belief network structures, such as Bayesian networks, to capture more nuanced relationships between beliefs. 
Rationale: This could lead to even more accurate synthetic users capable of mimicking complex, interdependent belief systems. 
Explore the potential for synthetic users to engage in dynamic interactions and update their beliefs based on new information or persuasive arguments. 
Rationale: This would enhance the realism of synthetic users and allow for more sophisticated modeling of opinion dynamics and information spread. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The study found that demographic information alone was insufficient for accurate mimicry of human opinions. However, when combined with belief network information, LLM agents showed significantly improved alignment with human responses, particularly for topics closely related in the belief network. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: These findings suggest that creating accurate synthetic users requires more than simple demographic prompting. Incorporating belief network structures and seeding with relevant opinions may be necessary to achieve realistic mimicry across a range of topics. However, the varying degrees of alignment across different topics indicate that perfect accuracy remains a challenge. 
Overall Assessment 
The study provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of using LLMs to create synthetic users that accurately mimic human opinions. While demographic information alone proved insufficient, the incorporation of belief network structures showed promise in improving alignment between LLM agents and human respondents. However, challenges remain in achieving consistent accuracy across all topics and in addressing ethical concerns associated with simulating potentially harmful beliefs. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The research supports the concept of synthetic users by demonstrating that LLMs can, with appropriate prompting and belief network information, produce opinions that align with human responses across multiple related topics. However, it also highlights the complexity involved in achieving accurate mimicry and the need for more sophisticated approaches than simple demographic-based prompting. 
Suggested Refinements 
Refinement: Incorporate dynamic belief updating mechanisms into synthetic user models 
Justification: This would allow for more realistic simulation of how human opinions change over time or in response to new information, enhancing the utility of synthetic users in modeling complex social dynamics. 
Refinement: Develop ethical guidelines and safeguards for the creation and use of synthetic users 
Justification: Given the potential for misuse and the ethical concerns raised in the study, clear guidelines are necessary to ensure responsible development and application of synthetic user technologies.

Comparison of human performance to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 
Analysis of accuracy based on speaker expertise and age 
Primary Findings 
GPT-4 performed best, followed by humans, then GPT-3.5 
Humans and GPT-4 showed similar patterns in judging expert vs. novice and adult vs. child speakers 
Item-level performance correlated between humans and GPT-4, but not GPT-3.5 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Accuracy of AI in mimicking human judgments: The study directly compares AI models' ability to make cultural consensus judgments to human performance, which is highly relevant to the question of how accurately synthetic users can represent human perspectives. 
Demographic sensitivity of AI models: The research examines how well AI models can distinguish between speakers of different expertise levels and ages, which relates to synthetic users' potential to represent diverse demographic groups. 
Supporting Evidence 
GPT-4 performed similarly to humans in judging speaker similarity based on expertise and age, with performance correlating across items. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that advanced AI models like GPT-4 may be capable of making human-like judgments about cultural consensus, supporting the potential for synthetic users to accurately represent human perspectives. 
The study found that "cultural consensus offer[s] a potentially powerful algorithm for inferring common ground, providing a mechanism for evaluating mutual knowledge between communication partners in contexts where the space of possibilities is vast, non-referential, and opaque to strangers." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that the cultural consensus framework could be a valuable approach for developing more accurate synthetic users that can infer and represent shared knowledge within specific cultural or demographic groups. 
Contradictory Evidence 
GPT-3.5 performed at chance level and showed different patterns from humans in judging expert vs. novice and adult vs. child speakers. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This highlights that not all AI models are equally capable of mimicking human judgments, suggesting that careful selection and validation of models is crucial for developing effective synthetic users. 
The study found no correlation between participants' self-rated sports expertise and their accuracy in distinguishing speakers in the task. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that self-reported expertise may not be a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy, which could complicate the development of synthetic users based on self-reported demographic or expertise information. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study focused on a single domain (sports) and a limited set of demographic factors (expertise and age). 
Potential Solution: Future research could expand to multiple domains and a broader range of demographic factors to assess the generalizability of AI models' ability to mimic human judgments across diverse contexts. 
The study used only brief language samples and a single-turn judgment task. 
Potential Solution: Investigating AI performance in multi-turn interactions and longer conversations could provide insights into developing more robust synthetic users capable of sustained engagement. 
Ethical Considerations 
The study raises questions about the ethical implications of using AI to make judgments about human cultural knowledge and group membership. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: When developing synthetic users, careful consideration must be given to the potential for bias and misrepresentation, especially when simulating diverse demographic groups. 
Practical Applications 
The cultural consensus framework could be applied to develop synthetic users that can more accurately represent shared knowledge within specific cultural or demographic groups. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This approach may offer greater flexibility and precision compared to traditional methods of creating user personas, as it allows for dynamic assessment of common ground based on language use. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The study notes that "since each person's lifetime experiences are an idiosyncratic mix of multiple cultures, this generates substantial individual variability in knowledge systems within demographic categories." 
Potential Mitigation: Developing synthetic users may require more nuanced approaches that account for individual variation within demographic groups, possibly through the integration of multiple cultural dimensions and personalized language models. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigate how cultural consensus judgments change over the course of multi-turn interactions. 
Rationale: This could provide insights into developing more dynamic and adaptive synthetic users capable of updating their representations of common ground throughout a conversation. 
Explore the combination of bottom-up language-based inferences with top-down situational cues in assessing common ground. 
Rationale: This could lead to more context-aware synthetic users that can adapt their behavior based on both linguistic and environmental factors. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The study found that GPT-4 performed similarly to humans in distinguishing between expert/novice and adult/child speakers, with correlated item-level performance. However, GPT-3.5 showed different patterns and performed at chance level. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: These findings suggest that advanced AI models like GPT-4 may be capable of accurately mimicking human judgments about speaker characteristics, which is promising for developing synthetic users. However, the performance gap between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 indicates that the choice of AI model is crucial, and not all models may be suitable for creating accurate synthetic users. 
Overall Assessment 
The study provides evidence that advanced AI models can make human-like judgments about cultural consensus and common ground based on language samples. This supports the potential for developing synthetic users that can accurately represent human perspectives. However, the research also highlights challenges related to individual variability, the importance of model selection, and the need for further investigation across diverse domains and demographic factors.

Explore the use of interactive visualization techniques similar to those in InsightLens to allow researchers to inspect and understand the decision-making processes of synthetic users. 
Rationale: This could increase transparency and trust in synthetic user research by providing insights into how AI models generate responses and make decisions when simulating user behavior. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The paper does not directly address the accuracy of demographic mimicry. However, the high accuracy (88.5%) in associating insights with relevant evidence and data context suggests that LLMs can maintain consistency in generated content, which is crucial for accurate persona representation. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: While this indicates potential for creating consistent synthetic user personas, the observed failure cases (e.g., fabricating attributes, topic disagreements) highlight the need for careful validation and refinement of LLM-generated responses to ensure accurate representation of specific demographic groups.

Authors: Ruiyi Wang, Stephanie Milani, Jamie C. Chiu, Jiayin Zhi, Shaun M. Eack, Travis Labrum, Samuel M. Murphy, Nev Jones, Kate Hardy, Hong Shen, Fei Fang, Zhiyu Zoey Chen 
Published: 2024 in arXiv preprint 
Research Question: Can large language models be used to create realistic simulated patients for training mental health professionals in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) skills? 
Key Methodologies 
Development of PATIENT-?, an LLM-based simulated patient framework 
Creation of PATIENT-?-CM, a dataset of 106 expert-created cognitive models 
Implementation of PATIENT-?-TRAINER, an interactive training tool 
User study with 20 mental health experts and 13 trainees 
Primary Findings 
PATIENT-? demonstrated higher fidelity to real patients compared to a GPT-4 baseline 
Experts and trainees found PATIENT-?-TRAINER more effective for improving CBT skills than existing methods 
PATIENT-? accurately reflected underlying cognitive models used in its creation 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
AI-generated personas for training: PATIENT-? uses LLMs to create simulated patients, similar to how Synthetic Users proposes using AI to generate diverse user personas. Both concepts aim to provide realistic, AI-generated representations of specific demographics or user groups. 
Accuracy of AI-generated responses: The paper extensively evaluates the fidelity and accuracy of PATIENT-? in mimicking real patients, which directly relates to the core question in Synthetic Users about how accurately AI models can mimic responses from specific demographic groups. 
Application in professional training: While Synthetic Users focuses on market research and user testing, PATIENT-? demonstrates a similar concept applied to professional training in mental health. This shows the potential for expanding the Synthetic Users concept to various fields. 
Supporting Evidence 
PATIENT-? demonstrated high fidelity to real patients across multiple dimensions, including emotional states, conversational styles, and maladaptive cognitions. Experts rated PATIENT-? as significantly more realistic than a GPT-4 baseline (p &lt; 10^-4). 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This provides strong evidence that LLMs can be effectively programmed to mimic specific user groups with high accuracy, supporting the core premise of Synthetic Users. 
The paper reports that "97% of the PATIENT-? patients [were rated] as at least moderately accurate in reflecting the reference cognitive model." This indicates high consistency between the intended patient profile and the AI's output. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that Synthetic Users could potentially achieve high accuracy in representing specific user profiles, enhancing its validity for research applications. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper notes that "automatic evaluations with LLMs fail to assess the simulated patient fidelity," with GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B showing opposite trends to expert evaluations when comparing PATIENT-? to the baseline. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This raises concerns about using AI to evaluate the accuracy of synthetic users, suggesting that human expertise may still be crucial in validating AI-generated personas. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study focused on mental health patients in a CBT context. It's unclear how well the approach would generalize to other domains or user types. 
Potential Solution: Conduct similar studies in diverse fields (e.g., consumer behavior, education) to test the generalizability of the approach for creating synthetic users across different domains. 
The paper does not explore how well PATIENT-? can represent diverse demographic backgrounds beyond the cognitive models used. 
Potential Solution: Expand the cognitive model dataset to explicitly include diverse demographic factors and evaluate how well the AI can represent intersectional identities. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper emphasizes that PATIENT-? is intended to augment, not replace, existing training methods. It provides a "safe training environment" for practice without risk to real patients. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This highlights the importance of positioning synthetic users as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for real user engagement, and considering the ethical implications of using AI-generated personas in place of real individuals. 
The researchers obtained IRB approval and informed consent from participants, emphasizing data privacy and providing crisis resources. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This underscores the need for ethical guidelines and safeguards when developing and deploying synthetic user technologies, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics or vulnerable populations. 
Practical Applications 
PATIENT-?-TRAINER provides an interactive environment for mental health trainees to practice CBT skills with diverse simulated patients. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: Experts noted that PATIENT-?-TRAINER offered advantages over traditional role-play, including "ease of access (90%), customization options of different conversational styles (90%), and interactive experience (65%)." This suggests synthetic users could provide more flexible, customizable, and accessible training experiences compared to traditional methods. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The study only measured perceived improvements after brief interactions with the system, rather than objective skill improvements over time. 
Potential Mitigation: Conduct longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials to assess long-term effectiveness and objective skill improvements from interacting with synthetic users. 
The paper notes that even advanced LLMs like GPT-4 struggled to create high-fidelity patient simulations, often behaving more like a therapist than a patient. 
Potential Mitigation: Further research into techniques for constraining LLM outputs to more accurately reflect specific user personas, potentially through improved prompting strategies or fine-tuning approaches. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigate the generalizability of the PATIENT-? approach to other domains beyond mental health. 
Rationale: This would help establish whether the synthetic user concept can be effectively applied across diverse fields and user types. 
Develop improved methods for automatically evaluating the fidelity of synthetic users to their intended personas. 
Rationale: The paper's finding that LLMs struggled to accurately assess patient fidelity highlights the need for better evaluation techniques to validate synthetic users at scale. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The paper demonstrates high accuracy in mimicking specific patient profiles based on cognitive models, with experts rating PATIENT-? as significantly more realistic than a GPT-4 baseline. However, the study did not explicitly focus on diverse demographic representation beyond the cognitive models used. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: These results suggest that LLMs can be effectively programmed to mimic specific user profiles with high fidelity, supporting the potential of synthetic users. However, more research is needed to verify accuracy across diverse demographic backgrounds and intersectional identities. 
Overall Assessment 
The PATIENT-? study provides strong evidence for the potential of using LLMs to create realistic simulated users for training purposes. It demonstrates high fidelity to intended user profiles and shows advantages over traditional training methods in terms of customization and accessibility. However, challenges remain in automatic evaluation, generalizability to other domains, and ensuring diverse demographic representation. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The study's success in creating realistic simulated patients that experts found more effective than traditional methods strongly supports the core concept of Synthetic Users. It demonstrates that LLMs can be used to create AI-generated personas that accurately represent specific user groups, at least in the context of mental health patients. 
Suggested Refinements 
Refinement: Incorporate explicit demographic factors into the cognitive models used to program synthetic users. 
Justification: This would allow for more comprehensive evaluation of how accurately AI can represent diverse user backgrounds and intersectional identities. 
Refinement: Develop improved methods for automatically evaluating the fidelity of synthetic users to their intended personas. 
Justification: The paper's finding that LLMs struggled to accurately assess patient fidelity highlights the need for better evaluation techniques to validate synthetic users at scale without relying solely on human experts.

Emotional prompting can lead to more optimal strategies in some scenarios 
The source of emotions (internal, external, or opponent-induced) affects LLM responses 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Emotional simulation in AI agents: The paper demonstrates that LLMs can be prompted to simulate different emotional states, which is crucial for creating realistic synthetic users that can respond with appropriate emotional nuance. 
Alignment with human behavior: The study shows that LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5, can closely mimic human behavior in certain scenarios, supporting the potential of using LLMs as synthetic users in research. 
Demographic variability: While not directly addressing demographics, the paper's exploration of emotional variability suggests that LLMs might be capable of simulating different user profiles based on emotional tendencies. 
Supporting Evidence 
The study found that GPT-3.5 showed strong alignment with human behavior in bargaining games, particularly in the Dictator Game where it offered an average of 35.23% of the total budget, close to the 28.35% observed in human studies. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that LLMs could potentially serve as accurate synthetic users in economic behavior studies, mimicking human decision-making patterns. 
The researchers successfully induced different emotional states in LLMs through prompting, which affected their decision-making processes in ways similar to human emotional responses. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This capability is crucial for creating synthetic users that can realistically represent diverse emotional states and reactions in research scenarios. 
Contradictory Evidence 
GPT-4 exhibited more consistent, rational behavior across different emotional states, often defaulting to perfectly fair decisions (e.g., always offering a 50-50 split in the Dictator Game). 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests that more advanced LLMs might not always provide the most human-like responses, potentially limiting their effectiveness as synthetic users in certain scenarios. 
The study found that GPT-3.5 sometimes exhibited exaggerated emotional responses, such as rejecting all offers when in an angry state in the Ultimatum Game, which is not typical of human behavior. 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This indicates that careful calibration and validation would be necessary when using LLMs as synthetic users to ensure realistic behavioral patterns. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The study did not explore the impact of cultural or demographic factors on LLM decision-making in game theory scenarios. 
Potential Solution: Future research could investigate whether LLMs can be prompted to simulate decision-making patterns typical of specific cultural or demographic groups, enhancing their potential as synthetic users. 
The paper focused on a limited set of game theory scenarios and did not explore more complex, multi-step decision-making processes. 
Potential Solution: Expanding the research to include a wider range of scenarios and decision-making tasks could provide a more comprehensive understanding of LLMs' capabilities as synthetic users. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper raises questions about the ethical implications of using emotionally-prompted LLMs in decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes scenarios. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: When using LLMs as synthetic users, researchers must consider the ethical implications of simulating human emotional states and decision-making, especially if the results could influence real-world policies or practices. 
The study reveals that LLMs can be influenced by emotional prompts, potentially leading to biased or irrational decisions. 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This highlights the need for careful control and transparency when using LLMs as synthetic users, to avoid introducing unintended biases into research findings. 
Practical Applications 
Using emotionally-prompted LLMs to simulate diverse user responses in product testing or market research scenarios. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This approach could potentially provide faster, more scalable, and more diverse feedback compared to traditional human participant studies, while still capturing emotional nuances in decision-making. 
Employing LLMs as synthetic users in preliminary stages of behavioral economics research to generate hypotheses and refine experimental designs. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This could reduce costs and time associated with initial human participant studies, allowing researchers to explore a wider range of scenarios before conducting live experiments. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The study found differences in behavior between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, indicating that the choice of LLM model significantly impacts results. 
Potential Mitigation: Researchers using LLMs as synthetic users should carefully select and validate the most appropriate model for their specific use case, potentially using multiple models to cross-verify results. 
The paper noted that emotional prompting sometimes led to exaggerated or inconsistent responses, particularly in GPT-3.5. 
Potential Mitigation: Developing more sophisticated emotional prompting techniques and implementing checks to ensure consistent and realistic emotional responses would be necessary for reliable synthetic user simulations. 
Future Research Directions 
Investigating the ability of LLMs to simulate decision-making patterns of specific demographic or cultural groups in game theory scenarios. 
Rationale: This would directly address the question of how accurately LLMs can mimic responses from particular user groups, a key aspect of the Synthetic Users concept. 
Exploring the long-term consistency and adaptability of emotionally-prompted LLMs in extended decision-making scenarios. 
Rationale: Understanding how well LLMs can maintain consistent synthetic user personas over time is crucial for their potential application in longitudinal studies or complex, multi-stage research scenarios. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: While the study did not directly address demographic mimicry, it demonstrated that LLMs can accurately simulate certain aspects of human decision-making, particularly emotional influences on choices. GPT-3.5 showed strong alignment with average human behavior in several game theory scenarios. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to serve as reasonably accurate synthetic users, at least for average behavioral patterns. However, more research is needed to determine their ability to mimic specific demographic groups accurately. The observed differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 indicate that careful model selection and validation would be crucial for creating representative synthetic users. 
Overall Assessment 
The study provides compelling evidence that LLMs can simulate human-like decision-making processes in game theory scenarios, including the influence of emotions on choices. While there are limitations and areas requiring further research, the results suggest significant potential for using LLMs as synthetic users in certain research contexts. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The paper demonstrates that LLMs can be prompted to exhibit human-like behavior patterns and emotional responses, which is fundamental to the concept of synthetic users. The strong alignment of GPT-3.5 with human behavior in several scenarios supports the feasibility of using LLMs to simulate user responses in research settings. 
Suggested Refinements 
Refinement: Develop more nuanced emotional prompting techniques to avoid exaggerated responses and ensure consistent, realistic emotional simulations. 
Justification: This would address the observed issues with overly strong emotional responses in some scenarios, improving the reliability of LLMs as synthetic users. 
Refinement: Conduct targeted research on LLMs' ability to mimic decision-making patterns of specific demographic groups. 
Justification: This would directly address the key question of how accurately LLMs can represent particular user groups, which is central to the Synthetic Users concept.

Towards Integrating Human-in-the-loop Control in Proactive Intelligent Personalised Agents 
Authors: Awais Akbar, Owen Conlan 
Published: 2024 in UMAP Adjunct '24 
Research Question: How can Human-in-the-loop (HITL) control be integrated into Proactive Intelligent Personalised Agents (PIPAs) to balance agent autonomy and user control? 
Key Methodologies 
Simulation-based approach 
Creating synthetic user profiles based on real travel survey data 
Modeling user context and intent prediction 
Primary Findings 
HITL control should be triggered based on user preferences, cost factors, and uncertainty in user intent 
Varying levels of PIPA autonomy impact agent efficacy in different interaction scenarios 
Simulations offer advantages in exploring diverse scenarios and multi-agent interactions 
Relevance to Synthetic Users 
Creation of Synthetic User Profiles: The paper describes creating synthetic users based on real travel survey data, which aligns with the Synthetic Users concept of generating AI-based user personas. However, this approach uses clustering of real data rather than LLM-generated responses. 
Simulation-Based User Research: The paper's use of simulations to explore user behavior and agent interactions relates to the Synthetic Users concept of using AI to gather insights without direct human involvement. 
Modeling User Context and Intent: The paper's focus on predicting user intent based on context relates to the Synthetic Users goal of accurately mimicking responses from specific user groups. 
Supporting Evidence 
The paper successfully creates synthetic user profiles based on real travel survey data: "We create synthetic users by analysing user behaviour patterns within the data. First, we cluster users based on similarities in their travel choices. Then, we utilise these clusters to fabricate synthetic users that represent the real-world distribution of travel behaviour in the dataset." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This approach demonstrates a method for creating synthetic users that closely represent real-world behavior patterns, supporting the potential validity of synthetic user research. 
The paper highlights the benefits of simulation-based approaches: "Simulations enable the creation of diverse scenarios across extended time frames. Unlike real-world limitations, where user engagement beyond short periods is challenging, simulations can seamlessly test agent performance over a 24-hour cycle (t1-t24)." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This supports the Synthetic Users concept by demonstrating how synthetic approaches can overcome limitations of traditional user research methods. 
Contradictory Evidence 
The paper acknowledges limitations in creating fully synthetic data: "However, this approach presents challenges in ensuring validity. A simple rule-based approach with predefined conditions for travel mode selection may not adequately reflect real-world user behaviour." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This highlights potential accuracy limitations of synthetic user data, especially when moving beyond using real data as a foundation. 
The paper notes challenges in capturing complex human decision-making: "While simulations have numerous advantages, they may struggle to fully capture the intricacies of human decision-making, which can be unpredictable and evolve over time." 
Impact On Synthetic Users: This suggests potential limitations in the ability of synthetic users to accurately mimic nuanced human behavior and decision-making processes. 
Gaps and Opportunities 
The paper focuses on creating synthetic users based on real data, but doesn't explore using large language models to generate purely synthetic responses. 
Potential Solution: Future research could investigate combining the paper's data-driven approach with LLM-generated responses to create more diverse and adaptable synthetic user profiles. 
The paper doesn't address how to validate the accuracy of synthetic user behavior against real users in live scenarios. 
Potential Solution: Develop methodologies to compare synthetic user predictions against real-world user studies to assess accuracy and refine synthetic models. 
Ethical Considerations 
The paper mentions privacy concerns related to using real user data: "While including user context factors in real data is problematic due to privacy concerns, purely synthetic context data also presents evaluation challenges." 
Relevance To Synthetic Users: This highlights the potential for synthetic users to address privacy concerns in research, but also raises questions about the ethics of creating synthetic personas that might be mistaken for real individuals. 
Practical Applications 
The paper demonstrates using synthetic users and simulations to test proactive intelligent agents in travel assistance scenarios. 
Comparison To Traditional Methods: This approach allows for testing a wider range of scenarios and user types than would be feasible with traditional user studies, while also avoiding privacy concerns associated with using real user data. 
Limitations and Challenges 
The paper notes difficulties in creating synthetic data for user preferences regarding agent autonomy: "publicly available user travel datasets typically do not include preferences regarding agent autonomy, making it difficult to align synthetic data for both travel mode choice and autonomy preferences." 
Potential Mitigation: Conduct focused studies on user preferences for AI agent autonomy to inform more accurate synthetic user models in this domain. 
The paper acknowledges challenges in fully capturing human unpredictability: "real users can be unpredictable in their decision-making, and their preferences and behaviours can evolve over time." 
Potential Mitigation: Develop more sophisticated models that incorporate elements of randomness and evolving preferences to better mimic real human behavior patterns. 
Future Research Directions 
Explore combining data-driven synthetic user creation with LLM-generated responses to create more flexible and diverse synthetic user profiles. 
Rationale: This could potentially overcome limitations in available data while still grounding synthetic users in real-world behavior patterns. 
Develop robust validation methodologies to compare synthetic user behavior against real users in various domains. 
Rationale: This is crucial for establishing the reliability and applicability of synthetic user research across different fields and use cases. 
Accuracy of Demographic Mimicry 
Findings: The paper demonstrates some success in creating synthetic users that represent real-world travel behavior distributions. However, it also acknowledges limitations in capturing nuanced decision-making and evolving preferences. 
Implications for Synthetic Users: While synthetic users based on real data can approximate general behavior patterns, accurately mimicking specific demographic groups remains challenging, especially for complex behaviors and preferences not captured in existing datasets. 
Overall Assessment 
The paper presents a promising approach for creating and utilizing synthetic users in the context of proactive intelligent agents. While it demonstrates potential benefits in terms of scenario exploration and privacy preservation, it also highlights significant challenges in accurately representing complex human behavior and decision-making processes. 
Relation to Synthetic Users: supports 
The paper generally supports the concept of Synthetic Users by demonstrating practical applications and benefits. However, it also identifies important limitations and challenges that need to be addressed for the concept to reach its full potential. 
Suggested Refinements 
Refinement: Integrate more sophisticated AI models, potentially including LLMs, to generate synthetic user responses for aspects not covered by available data. 
Justification: This could help address the limitations in creating synthetic data for complex preferences and behaviors while maintaining a foundation in real-world patterns. 
Refinement: Develop comprehensive validation frameworks to assess the accuracy of synthetic users across various domains and demographic groups. 
Justification: This is crucial for establishing the reliability and generalizability of synthetic user research, addressing a key concern about the concept's validity.
