## What is A.I.M.S.?

A.I.M.S. (AI Managed Solutions) is a professional support platform that uses specialized AI agents orchestrated by **ACHEEVY** - your AI executive assistant.

### Governance Model

```
User → ACHEEVY → Boomer_Ang → Chicken_Hawk → Squad → Lil_Hawks
```

1. **ACHEEVY** approves plan and presents to user
2. **Boomer_Ang** validates scope against DSP limits
3. **Contract** issued to Chicken_Hawk with ShiftId
4. **Chicken_Hawk** spawns Squad with Lil_Hawks
5. **Lil_Hawks** execute and report (logs only)
6. **ACHEEVY** verifies receipt and closes

### Key Features

- **ACHEEVY**: Voice-first AI assistant that orchestrates complex tasks
- **Deploy Platform**: "Boomer_Angs on the Port" - containerized execution with Chicken_Hawk engine
- **Lil_Hawks**: Specialized worker bots with career progression (Hatchling → Chicken_Hawk)
- **Live Ops Theater**: Watch-only view of operations in progress
- **Circuit Box**: Central hub connecting ACHEEVY to execution layer
- **LUC (Live Usage Calculator)**: Real-time quota tracking and cost management
- **Model Garden**: 200+ AI models at your fingertips

### Core Principles

1. **Boomer_Angs NEVER have payment access** - they scout and recommend, ACHEEVY executes
2. **Production-ready only** - no mockups, no demos, only real working applications
3. **Fast delivery** - apps built in minutes to hours, not weeks or months
4. **Y-ISO Standards** - Internal quality and safety standards (Y-ISO-01 through Y-ISO-07)

## Deploy Platform

The Deploy Platform ("Boomer_Angs on the Port") is A.I.M.S.'s containerized execution system.

### Visual Metaphor

| Real-World | System |
|------------|--------|
| Container stacks | Versioned deploys |
| Cranes | Heavy-lift infra tasks |
| Ground crew | Lil_Hawk worker bots |
| Manifest | Deploy instructions |
| Receipt | Signed audit log |

### Execution Lanes

- **Deploy It**: Fast dispatch for pre-approved operations (low OEI)
- **Guide Me**: Consultative lane requiring approval before execution

### Workforce Structure

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Hatchling | New worker, needs mentorship |
| Apprentice | Learning, limited solo tasks |
| Journeyman | Trusted independent worker |
| Foreman | Can mentor, high privilege |
| Chicken_Hawk_Candidate | Promotion track |
| Chicken_Hawk | Full engine authority |
