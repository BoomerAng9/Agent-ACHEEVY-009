## What is A.I.M.S.?

A.I.M.S. (AI Managed Solutions) is a professional support platform that uses specialized AI agents ("Boomer_Angs") orchestrated by **ACHEEVY** - your AI executive assistant.

### Key Features

- **ACHEEVY**: Voice-first AI assistant that orchestrates complex tasks across departments
- **Boomer_Ang Agents**: Specialized workers that handle research, coding, shopping, and more
- **LUC (Live Usage Calculator)**: Real-time quota tracking and cost management
- **Model Garden**: 200+ AI models at your fingertips

### Core Principles

1. **Boomer_Angs NEVER have payment access** - they scout and recommend, ACHEEVY executes
2. **Production-ready only** - no mockups, no demos, only real working applications
3. **Fast delivery** - apps built in minutes to hours, not weeks or months
