# A.I.M.S. - AI Managed Solutions
### AI Managed Solutions Platform

**PlugMeIn.com | ACHEEVY | AVVA NOON | Chicken Hawk**

## Overview
A.I.M.S. is a professional support platform for experts and freelancers to get work done via specialized AI agents ("Boomer_Angs"). It uses **ACHEEVY** as the primary executive orchestrator in a voice-first, NLP-driven interface.

This repository contains the bootstrap implementation of the platform, featuring:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) with a clean, "Obsidian/Gold" SaaS UI.
- **Backend**: UEF Gateway (Node.js/TypeScript) implementing ACP, UCP, and LUC.
- **Protocols**: 
    - **ACP** (Agentic Communication Protocol)
    - **UCP** (Universal Commerce Protocol)
    - **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) definitions.

## Project Structure
*(See `PROJECT_TREE.md` for full layout)*

- `frontend/`: Next.js 14 application.
- `backend/uef-gateway/`: Core orchestration service.
- `infra/`: Docker Compose and env config.
- `mcp-tools/`: Tool definitions.
- `docs/`: Architecture documentation.

## Quickstart

1.  **Prerequisites**: Docker & Docker Compose installed.
2.  **Environment**:
    ```bash
    cp infra/.env.example infra/.env
    # Edit infra/.env with your keys (Firebase, LLM, Stripe)
    ```
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    cd infra
    docker compose up --build
    ```
4.  **Access**:
    - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
    - UEF Gateway: `http://localhost:3001`

## Implementation Status (One-Shot Bootstrap)
> [!WARNING]
> This is a bootstrap generation. Several components are **STUBBED** for architecture definition:

- **Agent Zero, OpenClaw, Chicken Hawk, n8n**: These are defined in `docker-compose.yml` but commented out or stubbed.
- **ORACLE**: Implemented as a structural 7-gate check within UEF, not a separate service.
- **ByteRover & VL-JEPA**: Implemented as mock clients in the backend to demonstrate protocol interfaces.

## Protocols
- **ACP**: Defines how the Frontend talks to UEF and UEF talks to Agents.
- **UCP**: Handles Cost (LUC) and Settlement (BAMARAM).
- **MCP**: Defines tools like `byterover.retrieve_context` and `python.run`.
