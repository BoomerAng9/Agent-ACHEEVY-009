# A.I.M.S. Implementation Audit — 2026-02-13

## What Changed

### 1. Design Token System (tailwind.config.ts)
- Added Circuit Box color tokens: `ink`, `cb-cyan`, `cb-green`, `cb-amber`, `cb-red`, `cb-fog`
- Added 8px base grid spacing: `cb-xs` through `cb-xl`, `cb-chip`, `cb-row`
- Added instrument-grade motion: `cb-toggle` (150ms), `cb-panel` (200ms)
- Added micro-motion keyframes: `cb-breathe`, `cb-scanline`, `cb-route-pulse`

### 2. Circuit Box Overhaul (circuit-box/page.tsx)
- **Owner/User role gating**: Uses `useSession()` to detect OWNER role
- **Owners see**: All panels, Control Plane (kill switch, autonomy, sandbox, budget, persona), Live Events feed, Security Rules, all service endpoints
- **Users see**: Reduced view — allowed service bays, BYOK fields, Social Channels, no infrastructure panels, no raw secrets, no owner-only toggles
- **New panels**: Social Channels, Live Events (owner-only), enhanced Control Plane
- **Design**: All panels use Circuit Box design tokens (ink backgrounds, status signals, 8px grid)
- **Motion**: 150ms toggle transitions, 200ms panel transitions, breathing glow on kill switch

### 3. Social Messaging Gateway
- **`/lib/social/gateway.ts`**: Provider-agnostic normalized message interface, link code system, audit trail
- **`/api/social/gateway/route.ts`**: Unified inbound webhook that normalizes events from all providers
- **`/api/social/link/route.ts`**: Account linking endpoint (claim codes from social platforms)

### 4. Telegram Fixes (telegram/webhook/route.ts)
- **Account linking**: `/start` now generates a 6-char link code with 10-minute expiry
- **Instructions**: Users told to paste code in Circuit Box > Social Channels > Telegram
- **`/disconnect`**: Unlinks Telegram from platform account
- **Round-trip**: Linked messages route through ACHEEVY LLM, responses return to Telegram
- **Unlinked guard**: Unlinked messages are rejected with instructions to /start

### 5. WhatsApp Adapter (whatsapp/webhook/route.ts)
- Meta webhook verification (hub.mode/hub.verify_token)
- Inbound message parsing (WhatsApp Cloud API format)
- Link flow: user sends "link" → receives code → claims in dashboard
- Outbound via WhatsApp Cloud API
- Routes through /api/social/gateway

### 6. Discord Adapter (discord/webhook/route.ts)
- Discord interaction verification (type 1 ping/pong)
- Message parsing with bot filter
- !link, !help, !disconnect commands
- Routes through /api/social/gateway

### 7. Landing Page (Hero.tsx, Footer.tsx)
- Hero copy locked: "Welcome to AI Managed Solutions." / "I'm ACHEEVY, at your service." / "What will we deploy today?"
- Card links redirect to `plugmein.cloud/chat` (app domain)
- Footer platform links redirect to `plugmein.cloud` dashboard routes
- Support email: admin@aimanagedsolutions.cloud
- GitHub link: BoomerAng9/AIMS

### 8. Brand Locks Enforced
- "Chicken Hawk" (two words, space) — enforced in Circuit Box, Live Events, Hero
- "Boomer_Ang" / "Lil_Hawk" with underscores — preserved
- "ACHEEVY" (all caps, no dashes) — enforced everywhere

### 9. Email Service Configuration
- Domain: aimanagedsolutions.cloud
- MX: mx1.hostinger.com, mx2.hostinger.com
- SPF: v=spf1 include:_spf.mail.hostinger.com ~all
- DKIM: hostingermail-a/b/c._domainkey CNAMEs
- DMARC: v=DMARC1; p=none
- First email: admin@aimanagedsolutions.cloud

## What Is Now Working
- Circuit Box with full owner/user role gating
- Social Channels panel in Circuit Box (setup steps for all 3 platforms)
- Telegram account linking flow (code generation → claim → round-trip chat)
- WhatsApp and Discord webhook adapters (ready for tokens)
- Live Events feed (owner-only, with scanline + color-coded events)
- Control Plane with kill switch, autonomy, sandbox, budget, persona controls
- Landing page hero with correct brand copy and plugmein.cloud routing

## What Is Still Blocked
- **WhatsApp**: Needs WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN, WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN, WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID env vars (requires Meta Business approval)
- **Discord**: Needs DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY env vars (requires bot creation in Discord Developer Portal)
- **In-memory stores**: Link codes and user mappings are in-memory — will need Firebase/DB persistence for production
- **Voice-first (ElevenLabs/Deepgram)**: API keys not configured — Circuit Box shows them as inactive with BYOK option
- **SSE live events**: Currently simulated with setInterval — needs real SSE endpoint wired to backend
