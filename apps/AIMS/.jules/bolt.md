## 2024-05-23 - High-Frequency Hook Re-renders
**Learning:** Custom hooks that manage high-frequency state (like 60fps audio levels) trigger re-renders in the consuming component, even if that component only passes the data to a child.
**Action:** Isolate high-frequency state into a dedicated visualizer component or hook that is only used at the leaf node, or return a reference/stream and let the leaf component manage the animation loop.
